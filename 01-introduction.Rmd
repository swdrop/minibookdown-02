#Introduction
This is (a second attempt of) a very brief recap of the Gotham FC at Washington Spirit game, and as a result, it is a very mini book.

More detail on the game can be found on the [Gotham FC site](https://www.gothamfc.com/news/gotham-fc-caps-road-swing-with-victory-over-washington-spirit).

#First Half
The score at the end of the first half was 3-0 in favor of Gotham FC, courtesy of a rookie and a veteran:

1. 3’- Sarah Schupansky, assisted by Lilly Reale
2. 32’ – Esther González (penalty kick)
3. 39’ – Esther González, assisted by Sarah Schupansky

Schupansky's goal was her first in the NWSL. Esther continued her impressive season start with her third brace.
